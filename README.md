Currently, as a Nation Sri Lanka is facing the biggest crisis after so many decades. The crisis created a negative impact on different aspects such as economy, education, physical health, food distribution. The economy is one of the biggest threats currently because recently all of the item’s prices have been increased by large amounts. Therefore, people who had an income as daily wage have faced the saddest situation since they do not have enough money to buy foods and do their day-to-day work as per usual. Because of this situation and when considering our project scope, our group members came-up with the idea by suggesting it would be great as well as useful if we create an app which mainly rescue foods from avoiding Wastages, also allow wealthy people who are capable of donating money and foods with full of security. First of all, we have divided our topic into four main categories and they are, Donator donates foods either online or as physical foods, Deliver who collects the goods by going to the donator’s location and do the task. When donator do online money transactions and virtual food donations there should be a person who manage all of these and he is known as Accountant in our application, at last There is another category called Charity which take set of names who requires aid for hungry. The important thing that has been done by charity is collect the donations from all the donators and distribute them among people who have been suffering from poverty.
